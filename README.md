# UIAutomation
To run the class from eclipse: 

right click on the class --> select Run As -> click on Run configuration, where we need to create a run configuration, since we are using maven project, so double click on Maven build to create it.
Note that the name should be the same as class name "ApplicationTest", select the workspace, and write clean test on the option "Goals"
